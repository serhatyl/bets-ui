# bets-ui

This project is a web application that displays a betting bulletin, allows users to select odds, and dynamically calculates potential winnings on a betting slip. The application is built with `React`, utilizes `Context API` for state management, and implements `react-window` for optimized rendering of large lists. A custom Webpack configuration is used for bundling the project.

## Technologies Used
